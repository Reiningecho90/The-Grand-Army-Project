# The Grand Army Project

## Overview
The Grand Army project is a project focused on building a game that can be played by anyone free of charge. The game will not be pay to win like other games, but will rather be built around the open source and completely free theme. This game will be released fully on January 1st 2022 when everything should be tested fully and working as it should. After that the game will recieve updates until they are no longer needed.

## Developers
The developing team for this project is me and friends, each of us can be contacted from this GitHub page.

## Where to Find Easier to Read Updates
Coming soon will be a Roblox DevForum page where everything will be tracked carefully.

## Supporting the project
After the game's alpha tests release there will be gamepasses released to donate to the creators of the game. all of the proceeds generated by the donations from thegame and the group will be funneled back into the game and the developers. If there is excess money after this there will eb giveaways on the group.
