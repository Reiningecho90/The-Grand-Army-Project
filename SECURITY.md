# Security Policy

## Player Security

All players who log into the game via the roblox website will have their progress saved securely. In the event of someone getting hacked there will be backups in place that revert the currency expended. More updates in this field will come soon along with the first release.

## Code Security

All code files will be hidden so no one can acces the code base for this project. Any files that are published are published under the MIT liscence so they can be used at anyone's disposal.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities should be reported to my email so I can fix them as soon as possible. They will be apllied to the game as soon as I can find a solution.
